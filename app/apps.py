    """
    This class represents the configuration for the Django application named 'app'.
    It is responsible for setting the application's default auto field type and 
    importing signal handlers when the application is ready.

    Attributes:
        default_auto_field (str): Specifies the type of auto-created primary key field to use by default.
        name (str): The name of the application.

    Methods:
        ready(): Imports the application's signal handlers.

        """
        This method is called when the application is ready. It imports the
        signal handlers defined in the 'app.signals' module.

        Usage:
            This method is automatically called by Django when the application is
            initialized. No direct call to this method is necessary.

        Notes:
            Ensure that the 'app.signals' module exists and contains the necessary
            signal handlers. Improper configuration or missing signal handlers can
            lead to application errors.

        Examples:
            To define a signal handler, create a 'signals.py' file in your 'app'
            directory and define your signals as follows:

            .. code-block:: python

                from django.db.models.signals import post_save
                from django.dispatch import receiver
                from .models import MyModel

                @receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
                def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
                    if created:
                        # Handle the signal
                        pass

            This signal handler will be imported and connected when the application
            is ready.
